I am an immunologist studying the host-pathogen interactions in bats to RNA viruses.

I use RNA-Seq transcriptomics and bioinformatics to study responses to infection or vaccination. 
Previous work has focused on white-nose syndrome WNS. 
We are now focused on anti-viral responses such as SARS-CoV2 and Ebola.

Together with colleagues at MUNI University, we are studying African fruit bats under natural conditions in Uganda.

My teaching interests include using RStats to teach bigdata data analysis using real-world transcriptomics datasets. 
I also teach a first-year CURE Lab for Biology majors.

I am an immunologist studying the immunology of bats with a focus on immune responses to viruses and fungi.

I use RNA-Seq transcriptomics and bioinformatics to study responses to infection or vaccination. 
Previous work has focused on white-nose syndrome WNS. 
We are now focused on anti-viral responses such as SARSCOV2 and Ebola 

Together with colleagues at MUNI University, we are studying African fruit bats under natural conditions in Uganda.

My teaching interests at a PUI include using RStats to teach bigdata dataanalysis using real-world transcriptomics datasets. 
I also teach a first-year CURE Lab for Biology majors.
